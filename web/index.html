You can still find the NAT Check code below,
but to use it you'll have to run your own set of servers
and modify the code to point to those servers.
Note that the "natbouncer" program the page incorrectly mentioned for a while
is actually just part of the "natserver" program now:
just run "natserver 1" and "natserver 2" on the primary servers,
and run "natserver 3" on the third ("bouncer") server .

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
If you are accessing the Internet from behind a
Network Address Translator (NAT) of some kind,
I would appreciate your help in surveying the behavior of different NATs,
in terms of how and whether they support a certain technique
for enabling peer-to-peer communication between NATted hosts
(particularly when <i>both</i> endpoints are behind NATs).
See below for a brief technical summary of the technique
and the properties of a NAT tested by NAT Check.
For an extended discussion of this technique and related issues,
please read
<a href="http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/draft-ford-midcom-p2p-03.txt">
my Internet Draft on the topic</a>.
(Comments and feedback are greatly appreciated!)
<b>Note:</b> this draft does NOT yet include a discussion
of the new TCP-based NAT P2P hole punching technique
that version 3 of NAT Check tests for.
A new version of teh Internet-Draft should be available shortly.

<p>
To participate, please download,
compile, and run this trivial C program on your system:
<a href="natcheck.c">natcheck.c</a>.
(If you are on a 64-bit machine,
then either add "-DHAVE_STDINT" to your compile command line
or edit the #define's toward the beginning appropriately.)
Alternatively, if you are the trusting type,
the following pre-compiled binaries are available:

<h2>Technical Explanation</h2>
</center>

<p>
This technique is fairly simple,
has been pointed out before 
(e.g., <a href="http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~dank/peer-nat.html">here</a>
and <a href="http://www.peer-to-peerwg.org/tech/nat/">here</a>),
and has been implemented
in a variety of on-line games and other peer-to-peer applications.
The purpose of this page is mainly to draw more attention to the technique
and to discover how widely compatible the technique is with current NATs.

<h3>The Technique</h3>

<p>
Suppose there are three communicating hosts: A, B, and C.
Host A is a "well-known" Internet server with a permanent IP address,
which acts as an "introducer" for the other two nodes.
(For example, Host A might be a well-known ultrapeer
or a game catalog server of some kind.)
Host B, using Host A's "introduction" services, would like to establish
a direct peer-to-peer connection with host C.
Both B and C, however, are behind (probably different)
network address/port translators,
and neither of them has exclusive use of any public IP address.

<p>
To initiate a peer-to-peer connection with host C,
host B first sends A a message requesting an "introduction" to host C.
A sends B a reply message containing C's IP address and UDP port number
<i>as reported by host C</i>,
in addition to C's IP address and UDP port number
<i>as observed by A</i>.
(If C is behind a NAT, then these two address/port combinations
will be different.)
At the same time, host A sends host C a message
containing B's IP address and UDP port numbers -
again, both the ones reported by B
and the ones observed by A,
which will be different if B is behind a NAT.

<p>
Now B and C each know that they want to initiate a connection with each other,
and they know each other's public (NATted)
as well as original IP addresses and UDP port numbers.
Both B and C now start attempting to send UDP messages directly to each other,
at each of the available addresses.
If B and C happen to be behind <i>the same</i> NAT,
then they will be able to communicate with each other directly
using their "originally reported" IP addresses and UDP port numbers.

<p>
In the more common case where B and C are behind <i>different</i> NATs,
the "originally reported" addresses will be useless
because they will both be private IP addresses in different addressing domains.
Instead, the IP address/UDP port combinations observed by A
can be used in this case to establish direct communication.
Although B's NAT will initially filter out any UDP packets
arriving from C's public (NATted) UDP port directed at B's public port,
the first UDP message B sends to C will cause B's NAT
to open up a new UDP session keyed on C's public port,
allowing future incoming traffic from C to pass through the NAT to B.
Similarly, the first few messages from B to C
may be filtered out by C's NAT,
but will be able to start passing through the firewall
as soon as C's first message to B causes C's NAT to open up a new session.
In this way,
each NAT is tricked into thinking that <i>its</i> respective internal host
is the "initiator" of this new session,
when in fact the session is fully symmetrical
and was initiated (with A's help) simultaneously in each direction.

<h3>Required NAT Behavior</h3>

<p>
There is one important requirement that the NATs must satisfy
in order for this technique to work:
the NATs must be designed so that they assign
only one (public IP address, public UDP port) pair
to each (internal IP address, internal UDP port) combination,
rather than allocating and assigning a new public UDP port
for each new UDP <i>session</i>.
Recall that a "session" in Internet terminology
is defined by the IP addresses and port numbers
of <i>both</i> communicating endpoints,
so host B's communication with host A is considered to be one session
while host B's communication with host C is a different session.
If B's NAT, for example,
assigns one public UDP port for B's communication with A,
and then assigns B a <i>different</i> public UDP port
for the new session B tries to open up with C,
then the above technique for peer-to-peer communication
will not work because C's messages to B will be directed to the wrong UDP port.

<p>
RFC 3022 explicitly allows and suggests that NATs behave
in the former, "desirable" fashion,
by maintaining a single (public IP, public port) mapping
for a given (internal IP, internal port) combination
independent of the number of active sessions involving this mapping.
This behavior is not only good for compatibility with UDP applications,
but it also helps to conserve the NAT's scarce pool of public port numbers.
Maintaining a consistent public port mapping
does not adversely affect security in any way, either,
because incoming traffic can still be <i>filtered</i>
on a per-session basis regardless of how addresses are <i>translated</i>.
There in fact appears to be no good reason <i>not</i>
to implement the desirable behavior in a NAT,
except perhaps for the implementation simplicity
of naively allocating a new public port for every new session.
Unfortunately, RFC 3022 does not <i>require</i> NATs
to implement the desirable behavior,
which has led me to wonder just how many real NATs actually do,
and hence this page.

<h3>What NAT Check Does</h3>

The program <a href="natcheck.c">natcheck.c</a>
is basically just a program that "pings" a well-known UDP port
at two different servers that are publically accessible on the Internet.
Both of these servers run the program
<a href="natserver.c">natserver.c</a>,
with the command-line arguments "1" and "2" respectively.
In addition, there a third "conspiring" server
runs natserver with the command-line argument "3".
Whenever each of the first two servers receives a UDP request,
it not only sends a reply directly to the sender of that request,
but also sends a message to the third server,
which in turn "bounces" the reply back to the original client.
The effect is that the client will receive not only solicited "ping" replies
from the server the request was directed to,
but also "unsolicited" replies from the third server.

<p>
To determine if the network address translator in use
is implementing the desirable behavior
of maintaining a single (public IP address, public port) mapping
for a given (client IP address, client port),
the client program <a href="natcheck.c">natcheck.c</a>
basically just initiates a sequence of simultaneous pings
to the first two servers
(in case some of the requests or replies are lost in transit)
and checks that the client's address and UDP port
as reported by both servers is the same.
If the NAT naively allocates a new public port for each new session,
then the source port as reported by the two servers will be different,
and it's time to upgrade your NAT.

<p>
The replies echoed from the third server
are used only to check whether the NAT
properly filters out unsolicited incoming traffic on a per-session basis.
Since the client never sends any messages to the third server,
if the NAT is properly implementing firewall functionality,
the client should never see the third server's echoed replies
even after opening up active communication sessions with the first two servers.

<h3>Changes in Version 2</h3>

Version 2 of NAT Check contains the following enhancements:

<ul>
<li>	The NAT Check client no longer attempts to guess
	whether you have Basic NAT or Network Address/Port Translation (NAPT).
	It turns to be quite difficult to test for this property reliably,
	because many NAPTs attempt to bind a private UDP port
	to a public port with the same port number
	if that port number is available,
	causing NAT Check to falsely report Basic NAT.
	The only way to test for this property reliably
	would be to run NAT Check
	on at least two client machines simultaneously,
	and since this property isn't terribly important to P2P apps
	it's just not worth the trouble.

<li>	The NAT Check client now tests for one additional NAT feature,
	which I call <i>loopback translation</i>.
	If a NAT supports loopback translation,
	it means that a host on the private network behind the NAT
	can communicate with other hosts on the same private network
	<i>using public (translated) port bindings assigned by the NAT</i>.
	Most NATs probably do not support this feature yet,
	but it may become increasingly important in the future
	where P2P clients may be located behind a common ISP-deployed NAT
	as well as individual home NATs.
	More details on loopback translation will appear
	in the next version of my Internet-Draft, to be released soon.

<li>	The NAT Check client program now has a command-line option, "-v",
	which turns on verbose messages during the test.
</ul>
